// Loudness gain resolution (feature: LUFS gain) — the single answer to "how
// many dB does this track get on air".
//
// Two consumers, and they MUST agree (#1240): the queue drain stamps the
// figure as `liq_amplify` so Liquidsoap applies it per track, and the
// stem-blend render bakes the same figure into the clip (the clip carries no
// liq_amplify of its own — see subsonic.getClipUri). When the two diverged,
// a rendered seam played at a different level than the track it handed off
// to, which is what "the stem files aren't volume matched to the regular
// track" was.
//
// The resolution order is the operator's `settings.loudness.source`: the
// embedded ReplayGain tag (whole-file R128, via Navidrome's OpenSubsonic
// replayGain field) first by default, else the analyzer's measured LUFS
// (leading window only — which is exactly why the render can't just use the
// measured value and call it equivalent). Null loudness from every allowed
// source → null gain → unity, today's behaviour for an untagged, unanalysed
// library.
