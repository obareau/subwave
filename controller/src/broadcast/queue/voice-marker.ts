// Air-time marker reader for spoken segments (#1382).
//
// Everything the controller knows about a segment is handoff-time: airVoice
// resolves when the path has been written into say.txt/intro.txt, which is one
// 0.5s Liquidsoap poll plus the request queue, the lead-in and the duck ramp
// before a listener hears the first word. radio.liq writes voice-playing.json
// the moment the clip actually starts feeding, carrying the `voiceId` the
// controller stamped into the clip's annotate: URI — so a segment can be told
// exactly when it went to air rather than when it was handed over.
//
// The STAMP is what matters, not the detection: `startedAt` comes from the
// mixer's own clock, so a consumer gets the exact air time even though this
// poller notices it up to POLL_MS later. That is why the cadence here is a
// cheap 500ms rather than something tighter.
//
// Degrading is deliberate and silent. A mixer that predates this marker never
// writes the file, so awaitVoiceAir() resolves null IMMEDIATELY (see
// markerFilePresent) rather than making every station without it wait out the
// timeout before its booth log and webhooks fire. Callers treat null as "air
// time unknown" and fall back to today's handoff-time behaviour.
//
// Part of the queue/ split - see ../queue.ts, which owns the Queue class.
