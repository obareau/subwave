// Authored prompt text, loaded from the .md files in llm/instructions/.
//
// WHY FILES. The agent system prompts are prose — editorial instructions to a
// model about how to run a radio station — and they were living inside TS
// template literals, interleaved with the conditional logic that assembles
// them. That made the prose hard to read as prose and its diffs hard to review:
// a wording change arrived as a patch to a `${}`-studded string, indistinguishable
// at a glance from a logic change. The same repo already treats this kind of
// text as text for operator skills (state/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md), so this
// follows that grain.
//
// WHAT DID NOT MOVE, DELIBERATELY. Only static blocks live in the .md files.
// The conditional assembly — which blocks apply to this persona, this show,
// this run — stays in TypeScript, because it is logic, and a template language
// with branches would be a worse version of the language it is written in.
// A section is a paragraph you could read aloud; anything with a decision in it
// is code.
//
// THESE ARE SOURCE, NOT OPERATOR CONFIG. They ship in the image (the controller
// runs from src/ via tsx, and both Dockerfiles COPY controller/src wholesale)
// and are NOT loaded from the state dir. That is on purpose: the picker prompt
// is coupled to the harness — the "one discovery round" paragraph has to agree
// with the provider's discovery budget (provider/capabilities.ts) — and unlike a
// skill, which merely fails to air a segment, a broken picker prompt breaks the
// station's core loop with no graceful degradation. Operator-facing prompt
// surfaces already exist and are separate: the persona souls, djHouseRules, and
// the SKILL.md briefs.
//
// Everything is read and validated ONCE at module load, so a malformed file or
// a missing section fails at boot rather than at 3am on a pick.
