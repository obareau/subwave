// Pins GET /themes' public read shape (#1300 bug 12).
//
// The endpoint answers "which theme should I paint" AND "which level decided
// that" — because reporting only the resolved id made "the setting didn't
// stick" and "a show is pinning its own palette" the same response, which is
// the reported bug: an operator saves a station theme, the admin UI applies it,
// and ThemeProvider's next poll repaints it away with nothing anywhere able to
// say why.
//
// Three contracts matter, and all three are load-bearing for a client that
// already shipped:
//
//   1. `active` keeps the value it has always had, in every case. The web
//      ThemeProvider and the Expo player read nothing else; provenance is
//      purely additive or it is a breaking change.
//   2. A show wins ONLY while its themeId still resolves to a known theme. A
//      stale pin (operator deleted the JSON) falls back to the station default
//      rather than painting nothing — the same lenient fallback the rest of the
//      theme system uses.
//   3. `activeShow` is null, never absent, when the station default wins, so a
//      client can destructure it without a presence check.
//
// Run: `tsx scripts/theme-provenance.test.ts` (or `npm test -- theme-prov`).
