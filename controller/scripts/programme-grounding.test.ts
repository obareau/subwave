// Pins the programme beats' grounding rule (issue #1301).
//
// The incident: a straight-talk feature aired "Nirvana's Smells Like Teen
// Spirit from Nevermind blasts in, with Butch Vig's punchy production…"
// sixteen seconds into an Anika track. Every fact in that line is true — what
// broke was the FRAMING. "blasts in" is present-tense on-air cue language, so
// the listener hears the host introducing a record that was never on the
// playout while something else is audible.
//
// Three properties are load-bearing, and each is a way the fix could be
// silently undone:
//
//  - The rule bans the CUE, not the noun. The obvious over-correction is
//    "never name a song or album", which guts the beat — a feature on the
//    birth of grunge that cannot name Nevermind is not a feature. So the test
//    asserts naming stays explicitly permitted, not just that a rule exists.
//  - The certainty half is SEPARATE and both halves must survive. Real facts
//    framed as a cue (what happened) and invented credits (what a small model
//    does) are independent failure modes; a rule covering one does not cover
//    the other, and the feature's pre-existing no-invented-data clause is not
//    a substitute for the framing ban.
//  - The rule reaches ALL FOUR beats. It lives in one constant precisely so it
//    cannot drift between them, but a constant nothing appends is exactly the
//    regression this guards — hence the assertions run against each beat's
//    RENDERED text, not against the constant alone. The intro and outro
//    carried no anti-fabrication line at all before this, and the intro is the
//    worst seat for it: "tease what's coming" invites a promise about a record
//    that will never air.
//
// The plan-side clause is pinned too, but as a frequency lever only, not a
// guard: runFeature reaches the ungrounded generator whenever a capability
// throws at air time (broadcast/programme.ts), which no plan wording prevents.
//
// STATE_DIR is redirected at a throwaway dir BEFORE the first import so
// settings.load() touches nothing real — same idiom as house-rules.test.ts.
