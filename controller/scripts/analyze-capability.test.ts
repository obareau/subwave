// Tests for music/analyze-capability.ts — whether an analysis pass widens its
// scope to backfill an optional dimension, and what it says when it doesn't.
//
// This is the decision behind the loudest half of #1300 bug 3. The reported
// symptom was "audio backfill: +90 already-analysed tracks missing an audio
// vector", the same 90 tracks every run forever, on a heavy analyzer whose CLAP
// weights could not be downloaded. Two separate defects met there:
//
//   1. The backend reported `capable: true` no matter what, because the probe
//      behind it is find_spec — "is torch installed" — evaluated at ready,
//      before any model has been asked to load. Fixed at the source (the worker
//      reports the loss, the sidecar remembers it across the idle respawn that
//      was resetting it), and what arrives here is the corrected answer.
//   2. When the answer IS false, the message assumed exactly one cause and told
//      the operator to switch to the heavy image — advice to do the thing they
//      had already done. That is what this module fixes, and why the messages
//      are asserted rather than just the booleans: the string is the entire
//      user-facing product of a broken analyzer.
// Run: `tsx scripts/analyze-capability.test.ts` (folded into `npm run test`).
