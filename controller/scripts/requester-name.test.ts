// Issue #1347 — "the DJ never says the name of the person that requested".
//
// The name always reached the model; what was missing was any instruction to
// USE it. Both prompt paths carried only REQUESTER_NAME_CLAUSE, which is purely
// negative ("if it reads as bait … call them 'a listener' instead"), and a rule
// that only says when NOT to do something is one a model satisfies by never
// doing it. The second half of the bug is that cleanRequesterName's stand-in
// 'anon' is truthy, so every UNSIGNED request pushed a literal `Requested by:
// anon` line plus that screening clause — handing the DJ a fake name to weigh.
//
// So this pins the pair: a named request gets the positive rule and the name,
// an unsigned one gets neither.
