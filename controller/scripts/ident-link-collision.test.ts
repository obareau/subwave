// Regression test for the ident-vs-link boundary guard (boundaryCarriesTrackVoice).
// Run: `tsx scripts/ident-link-collision.test.ts`.
//
// Issue #1258. Two talkers reach the same track boundary from different clocks:
//
//   - the station ident is WALL-CLOCK scheduled (cron at :15/:30/:45), then
//     deferred by announceAtNextTrack to the next track start;
//   - a link/intro is TRACK-TIED — it airs when its own song starts.
//
// So the ident lands exactly where a link already lives. They're different
// kinds, so no per-kind cooldown sees the pair, and airVoice's serialiser only
// stops them OVERLAPPING — back to back with no music between is what it
// produces. Reported as 16s and 25s gaps, i.e. one segment's own length.
//
// The guard answers one question — "does this boundary already speak?" — and
// airPendingVoice holds the ident for the next boundary when it does. These
// asserts pin both observed orderings and, crucially, that the ident is NOT
// suppressed at a boundary that turns out to be silent (idents must still air).
//
// node:assert-via-tsx style, matching scripts/stale-link.test.ts.
